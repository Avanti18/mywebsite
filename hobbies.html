      Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to
      mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include
      graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes,
      colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers,
      styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of
      drawing on graphics software in a computer. Common methods of digital
      drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or
      finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse.
      <br />
      There are many digital art programs and devices. A drawing instrument
      releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible
      mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other
      materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board,
      have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or
      whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public
      expression throughout human history. <br />
      It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating
      ideas.[1] The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one
      of the most common artistic activities. In addition to its more artistic
      forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation,
      architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. <br />
      A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is
      sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical
      drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.

      Dance is an art form consisting of sequences of body movements with
      aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully
      selected.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its
      choreography, by its repertoire of movements, done simultaneously with
      music or with instruments; or by its historical period or place of
      origin.[4] An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of
      theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not
      always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether
      social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or liturgical.
      Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like
      quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating,
      synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.
      <br />
      Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance is used as
      a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and
      activities. Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing
      competitions found across the world exhibiting various different styles
      and standards. Dance requires an equal amount of cognitive focus as well
      as physical strength. The demanding yet evolving art form allows
      individuals to express themselves creatively through movement, while
      enabling them to adapt movement that possesses a rhythmical pattern and
      fluid motions that allure an audience either onstage or on film. Dance is
      considered to be a very aesthetically pleasing art form.
