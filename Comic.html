        Born to a family of circus performers, Robin Grayson had  a   tough
        childhood growing up. As seen in "Dude Relax", the carnival animals used
        to bully him nonstop, and, even worse, his parents were killed in a
        tragic acrobat accident. The mega-rich playboy Bruce Wayne, otherwise
        known as Batman, adopted Robin and made him his sidekick, Robin (also
        known as the "Boy Wonder").[1]
